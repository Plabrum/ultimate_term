# Terminal Set up Script

This will hopefully be a rolling project that will install and configure a
terminal environment for consitency across machines. 

Anticpated workflow:
    1. SSH into VPS, immediate git clone this repo
    2. Run ./installer
    3. Easy coding

Installed items:
    1. ZSH as the main shell
    2. Oh my zsh for prettiness
    3. Vim and Vimrc
    4. Python 3


N.B. 
The monokai.vim file is made by someone else, I'll try and change it so that it
downloads from the source in the future - this is quick n dirty for now.
